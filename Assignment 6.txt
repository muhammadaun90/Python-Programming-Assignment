Answer1: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form 
of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often 
modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated

Answer 2: Benefits of OOPs:
- Modularity for easier troubleshooting. Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look.
- Reuse of code through inheritance. ...
- Flexibility through polymorphism. ...
- Effective problem solving.

Answer3: A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) 
and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. 
A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.

Answer4:
Class: In object-oriented programming , a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular 
kind of object . Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.
Object: In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, 
is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.
Attribute: In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. 
It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly 
be considered metadata.
Behavior: A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will "react" if asked to
do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to
themselves or have anything done to them.
